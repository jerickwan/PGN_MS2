# PGN_MS2: _In silico_ MS/MS prediction for peptidoglycan profiling

## Introduction
PGN_MS2 is a computational tool that generates a customizable peptidoglycan (PGN) database from user-defined parameters.
Furthermore, it can simulate MS/MS spectra for each PGN and compile these predicted MS/MS spectra to a spectral library in the NIST format (.msp).
The spectral library (.msp) is compatible with open-access and vendor software, e.g. MS-DIAL, for automated matching and scoring of experimental MS/MS peaks, facilitating automated PGN identification.

## Installation
PGN_MS2 is written in Python 3.9 and uses [RDKit](https://www.rdkit.org/) to manipulate molecules. A graphical user interface (built with [easygui](https://github.com/robertlugg/easygui)) is available.
The following Python packages are required:
```
Common
easygui
IPython
joblib
matplotlib
numpy
openpyxml
pandas
pyyaml
rdkit
```
The Python environment can be created with [Conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) using the following command:
```
conda env create -f /PATH/OF/PGN_MS2/environment.yaml
```
## Running PGN_MS2
### GUI
The GUI of PGN_MS2 can be run from command line with the following command:
```
python /PATH/OF/PGN_MS2/UserInterface.py
```
A more detailed user guide for the GUI can be found [here.](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/15529917/SuppInfo1_User.Guide.to.PGN_MS2.v2.pdf)
### Running from IDE
Alternatively, PGN_MS2 can be run with an IDE.* Sample code is provided with ManualRun.py

*Spyder 3.9 is not compatible with RDKit and must be ran from a separate environment. See Spyder's [FAQ](https://docs.spyder-ide.org/current/faq.html#using-existing-environment) for more information.
### Output
Output is stored in /output.Each file is named with a prefix comprising the starting datetime and a user-given name (e.g. 20240605_Ecoli).
The various outputs are divided among the three subfolders as such:
| Subfolder     | Filename                                   | Description                                                                                   |

### Supported PGN Chemotypes
PGN_MS2 imports chemical information from an internal library located at:
```
data/PGN.xlsx
```
PGN_MS2 was designed to accomodate most [PGN chemotypes.](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6976.2007.00094.x) It is able to generate PGN with:
* modified glycans: acetylation (increase/decrease), glycolylation (anMurNGlyc) and dehydration (anMurNAc).
* stem peptide sequences up to eight amino acids long. Supported amino acids include the canonical amino acids as well as non-canonical amino acids commonly found in PGN (mDAP, Orn, Î³-isoGln).
* bridge peptides (i.e. branch peptides, side chains) that are attached to either diamino/dicarboxy amino acids in the stem peptide.
* a wide variety of modifications such as lactamization, endopeptidase digestion.
* two different polymerisation modes: either through glycosidic bonds or peptide bonds.
